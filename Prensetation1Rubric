Grading/details as follows (from the syllabus):
This presentation will be 10-12 minutes in length with 5 minutes for questions. The group will present to the entire class the problem they will aim to solve. This requires digging through the literature to present the background and motivation as well as the “current state” of things for the problem. This presentation must also discuss the language(s) and software that will be used for development and an outline of the key benchmarks that will be met each week throughout the remainder of the semester. Presentations will be graded as follows: 

• 1 pt. Clear presentation of the problem 

• 1 pt. Succinct (yet sufficient) introduction to the current state (other tools/solutions available) 

• 1 pt. Clear presentation of the project plan 

• 0.5 pts. Benchmarks are included 

• 0.5 pts. Slides are well organized, text is legible, slides highlight main points/concepts 

• 1 pt. Presenter is engaging. Team member fielding questions has command of knowledge. 

All team members will be assigned the same grade for the presentation. The presentation document (pptx/pdf) must be submitted before class on the day of the presentation by one team member.
